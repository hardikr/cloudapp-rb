So this is my fork of @aashay's fork of @holman's Cloudapp Ruby Script.</p>

<p>Basically, this let's you use cloudapp (http://getcloudapp.com) from the command-line in UNIX systems.
My contribution to the script was to let you email the link to someone.</p>

<p>You need ruby and gems installed to have this running.</p>

<p>P.S.: This is my first attempt at modifying a Ruby script, and I am just a beginner. But, it does work :P</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>1) Installing Requirements (for Ubuntu)</h3>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1
curl http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-1.8.10.tgz --O rubygems-1.8.10.tgz
tar -xzvf rubygems-1.8.10.tgz
cd rubygems-1.8.10
sudo ruby setup.rb

sudo gem install cloudapp_api
sudo gem install mail
sudo gem install ruby-gmail
</code></pre>

<h3>2) Grab the script, copy to /usr/bin and make it executable.</h3>

<pre><code>curl https://raw.github.com/hardikr/cloudapp-rb/master/cloudapp --O cloudapp
